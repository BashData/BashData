- 👋 Hi, I’m @BashData
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and specifically visualization
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google Data Analystics Professional Certificate and doing tutorials on Tableau
- 💞️ Not ready just yet to colloborate I think as I'm still very new to this field and my only experience is analysis is when I used to analyze social media analytics for clients
- 📫 How to reach me: hit me up here with whatever you got :)
